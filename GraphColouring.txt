Graph colourng is the process of colouring a graph nodes in such a way that no two adjacent nodes have the same colour.
Chromatic number of a graph is the munimum number of colours required to colour the graph properly that follows the above condition.
This algorithm finds the chromatic number of a graph whose 
1) no. of vertices
2)no. of edges 
3) n edges like 23,45, .... 
is given by the user at run time,and a corresponding adjacency matrix is created upon which the algorithm works.
This program also creates a graph using matplotlib pyplot of the coloured graph.
[*NOTE:     This algorithm is sensitive to numbering of nodes i.e in some cases different node numbering may yield different chromatic numbers for the same graph]
In this algorithm i am using numbers as colour like 1000,1001,1002..... and since matplotlib pyplot is not allowing to assign two nodes with same node no.(here colour),
i am using 1000 and 1000.1 1000.2 ..... as same colour ,similarly 1003.4 and 1003.5 are also same colours.
This algorithm may produce slightly different visual graph for disjoint graphs but chromatic number may be correct.
